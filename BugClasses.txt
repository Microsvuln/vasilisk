We can grab a corpus of bugs from an issue tracker as our test cases for fuzzing




Coverage metric that focuses on different passes, and instrument a very specific area of v8. Our means over AFL is specifyin g instrumentation.


JS O1 O2 O3 O4 and looking at code gen, hamming distance and specific hchanges are important
Angr Validator

Better validation metric (differential fuzzing)
